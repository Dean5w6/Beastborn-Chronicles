### üìñ About the Game

Beastborn Chronicles is a fantasy adventure game set in a world once shaped by colossal ancient beasts. Long ago, these titanic beings commanded the land, sea, and sky before vanishing, leaving behind only ruins, legends, and dormant powers waiting to be awakened.

### üìú Story Synopsis

The story begins when a small, adaptive creature named Varexon encounters one of these colossal beings‚Äîthe Colossus. Despite his courage, Varexon is struck down in the clash, losing his memories and reverting to his youngest, most vulnerable form.

From that point, the player guides Varexon on a journey across multiple worlds, each filled with unique beasts and challenges. By battling, training, foraging, and surviving, Varexon gradually evolves through many forms. Each world escalates in difficulty and introduces powerful adversaries, some of which evolve across multiple phases until reaching their ultimate form.

The overarching theme of Beastborn Chronicles is growth, survival, and destiny‚Äîthe rise of a small, forgotten beast into a legendary creature capable of facing the ancient forces that once ruled the world.

### üêæ Meet Varexon - The Protagonist

#### Character Concept
Varexon is the protagonist and playable creature in Beastborn Chronicles. Unlike other beasts, Varexon is balanced and adaptive, capable of adjusting his attack and defense depending on the battle. This adaptability symbolizes his role as a survivor who must learn and evolve to overcome every obstacle. Varexon has up to 18 planned evolutions, each marking a milestone in his journey back to power.

#### Base Form Appearance (Child Form)
*   **Species/Type:** A small, dronic-wolf-like beast.
*   **Body:** Covered in soft, cyan-blue fur.
*   **Wings:** Tiny, undeveloped bat-like wings that glow faintly at the edges.
*   **Eyes:** Large, expressive amber eyes filled with determination.
*   **Stature:** Always stands bipedal (upright on two legs), giving him the look of a small mythical guardian.
*   **Overall Impression:** Cute yet determined; fragile yet full of potential‚Äîthe perfect foundation for a creature destined for greatness.

### üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

The gameplay revolves around strengthening Varexon through four main actions available in the **Action Menu**:

*   **Battle:** Engage in combat with enemy beasts across different stages.
*   **Train:** Increase Varexon's **Strength** stat, allowing him to deal more damage in battles.
*   **Forage:** Gather resources to increase **XP**. Gaining enough XP will raise Varexon's **Level**, eventually triggering his evolution at key milestones.
*   **Rest:** Recover and increase Varexon's **Max HP**, improving his survivability.

The game is divided into stages, with each stage featuring a unique enemy to defeat.
